This web app allows you to create a dynamic Browser Source overlay to display your League of Legends ranked stats.

After generating a link via the form, create a Browser Source in OBS and set the URL to the generated link.

## Creating a Browser Source

To use the overlay in OBS, head on to the website to generate a link and copy it.
Then, in OBS, click on the '+' under the "Sources" panel, and pick "Browser":

Create the browser source, and then paste the generated link in the URL field:

You can also change the width and the height to crop the size of the browser, 300x100 seems like a good size.

Now just click OK, and you're done! You can move/resize the browser source in the scene, and the overlay will refresh it's information every 20 minutes.
